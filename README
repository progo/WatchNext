WatchNext
=========

A bash script that saves a pointer to your last watched show of something. When
you feel like watching the next show following the last one, you simply run
`WatchNext.sh` and mplayer pops up. You may reset and fiddle with the settings.



Current usage
-------------

Watch shows and keep a pointer of recently viewed ones.
Usage: WatchNext [options] 
   -h         this help
   -d         do a dry run
   -r <file>  reset pointer to this file
   -w         watch the last video again
   -m         don't play; just print the next (advances the pointer)
   -f         ignore $WATCHNEXT_PLAYER, use default (mplayer -fs)

Use env variable $WATCHNEXT_PLAYER to setup your preferred app.



TODOs and things
----------------

There are couple of problems with directory and file matches. I'd prefer a way
to search without any globbings or regexp, because they aren't needed here.

Please chime in if you have an idea :)
