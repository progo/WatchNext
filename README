WatchNext

A bash script that saves a pointer to your last watched show of something. When
you feel like watching the next show following the last one, you simply run
`WatchNext.sh` and mplayer pops up. You may reset and fiddle with the settings.

Current usage:

    Watch shows and this keeps record of them for you.
    Usage: `basename $0` [options] 
       -h         this help
       -d         do a dry run
       -r <file>  reset to this file
       -m         don't run mplayer; just print the next
       -v         run vlc instead

There are couple of problems with directory and file matches. I'd prefer a way
to search without any globbings or regexp, because they aren't needed here.

Please chime in if you have an idea :)
